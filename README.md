# Just1 - An Open-Source Mecanum Wheel Robot

Just1 is an open-source robotics platform designed for learning, experimentation, and fun! Built around a Raspberry Pi and equipped with mecanum wheels, this robot offers both manual control and autonomous navigation capabilities.

## Features

- **Mecanum Wheel Drive System**: Enables omnidirectional movement for precise control
- **Raspberry Pi Brain**: Powerful computing platform for autonomous operations
- **Camera Integration**: For computer vision and navigation
- **Dual Control Modes**:
  - Manual control for direct operation
  - Autonomous navigation for hands-free operation
- **Middleware**: Integrated with ROS2
- **Open-Source Design**: Easy to build and modify

## Project Goals

Just1 was created with several objectives in mind:
- Provide a fun and engaging robotics platform
- Develop practical robotics and programming skills
- Share knowledge and encourage others to build their own robots
- Create an accessible platform for learning and experimentation
